THE EPIC OF AENEAS.

——000—

THE AEneid has stood for many centuries as a model of Epic Poetry.
Properly speaking, however, an Epic consists of a body of immemorial
tradition, which has taken form in the mind and language of a people3
and which, while the traditions were yet living and believed in, has been
worked up in a single poem, or group of poems, whose antiquity and
national character have made them, in some sense, sacred books. This
is what the poenis of Homer were to the Greeks„the Mahabharata and
Ramayana to the Hindoos, and the Niebelungen to the Germans.

The AEueid is an Epic in a very different sense,—in what, for the
sake of distinction, may be called the literary sense. Though it has the
foundation of traditionS, and all the divine machinery of the true Epic,

yet the traditions are no longer living; the divine machinery is no

longer a matter of belief. The traditions are dug out by antiquarian
research. The machinery is manufactured to order, as it were, in a niod-
ern workshop. Many of the incidents are labored invention, while the
whole is written with a definite purpose, as a work os art. These things
put it in a widely different class srorn the Iliad and Odyssey, which serve
in some sense as its models, :ind with which it has been oftenest compared.

Still the purpose for which it was written distinguishes it clearly from
other artificial Epics and raise it more nearly to the level of the Epic
proper. It was not written merely as a work· of art, nor from a casual
poetic inspiration. It is the product of a patriotic national sentiment and
a belief in the divine origin and destiny of the Roman State. It is said
that the poem was written at the request of Augustus. But it is no mere
flattery of a reigning house. The supremacy of the Julian family was
identified in the mind of the poet and his readers with the culmination of
the Roman State in victory and peace, the predestined consummation of

ages of vicissitudes and struggles.
