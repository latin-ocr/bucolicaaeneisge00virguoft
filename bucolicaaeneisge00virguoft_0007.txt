NOTE.

—4—

THE text of this edition follows Ribbeck in the main, adhering‚
however, to the received reading where he seems to be not fully

supported by his own apparatus critiam. Variations are indicated
in the margin.

It is hoped that the many wood-cuts‚ all taken from ancient
objects of art, will serve to illustrate the poet's conception better
than annotations alone could do. The grammatica] references
are to Allen and Greenouglss Latin Grammar, and to those of
Prof. Gildersleeve and Prof. Harkness. The Botanical Index is
derived chiefly from Fee's Flore de magde, contained in Lemaire's
“ Bibliotheca Classica Latina.“'

All the material that was available has been retained from
Allen and Greenough's Virgils,3inc·luding‚ among other things, the
Life of Virgil, the Summaries¹ oflt'he separate books, and the List

of Plants. ⁶ r

The second volume will contain the remainder of the AEneid,

with the Georgics.
