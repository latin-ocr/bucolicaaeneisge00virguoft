IV. 457.] Tlce AEncz'd. 207

Anchises ,· an allusion to a story that Anehises' bones were taken from
the tomb by Diomed, but afterwards restored to AEZneas. The Manes
would doubtless be disquieted at the violation of the sepulchre.

428. cur· neget, (Le. since that is not so), wlty tlzen, etc. ?

430. exspectet, ete., compare v. 309: at least let him wait for calmet
seas and favorable winds.

432. pulchro, lzz's beautiful, with a sarcastic emphasis.

433. tempus inane, mere time, with, perhaps, the special idea of
its being useless to him as well as to her.—1·equiem‚ etc., time sor rest
(hendiadys), i.e. time for her madness to subside.

4 34. (lum doceat, until my Jbrtune may [σαι-Ι] me, subducti [as I
shall then be], 'stow to suffer.

436. quam . . . remittam. This line has been for centuries an
insoluble riddle. The old sense, approved also by Ladewig, is more in-
telligible than any other. “lVlzen lte slmll slave granted llu’ favor (i.e.
the short delay), I will repay z‘t many sold (cumulatam) lay my dmths’
Her death which she has already spoken of, v. 385, would be the best
solution of the difficulty sor sEneas, and so a boon; not that she thinks
of suicide, but she expects to die of a broken heart. The monte of Rib-
beck is almost ludicrous.

437. talis, acc. plur. —fletus, tem‘fulprayers.

438. fertque refertque, bears again and again.

439. tractabilis, ‘arz'elding

440. placidas, lez'naZw.

449. mens, llis purpose as opposed to his feelings (pectus).—la-
crimaz² . . . inanes, 01sz idle leurs ‹za-c slzca' (by ⁴‘E1ieas).-—inanes‚

451. convexa, compare strata viarum, i. 422.

452. quo magis peragat, etc.‚ mat slze may llze more surely fulfil
lter purpose and sors-alce lise. Observe the irregular sequence of tenses,
which is allowed by the different relation of the clauses; cf. i. 298. The
construction is that of purpose, by a poetic figure, as if it were the purpose
of the fates, a construction which naturally allows the primary sequence,
while the construction with cum (as in imponeret) never does.

456. hoc visum, etc.‚ llzz's siglzt slze tells lo none.

457. templum, a shrine (same root as τὲιινω, cut, and used of any
spot consecrated by special rites). It was for the adoration of the manes
of S'ychaeuS, a Roman custom of great antiquity.
