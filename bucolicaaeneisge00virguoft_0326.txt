94 Notes. [AENEID.

381. bis denis: the distributive is used, because ten are counted eaclz
time (ξ 95, c; G. 95, R.1; H. 174, 2). — conscendi aequor, l climbed
tlte sea, because the sea seems to rise as it recedes (cf. zv. 365), or simply
embnrkeclapem—navibus (ξ 248; G. 391, R·'²; H. 420).

382. data, spoken at various times (see ii. 7713 iii. 94, 154).

383. vix, i.e. and these with difficulty.

384. ipse, opposed to the ships. — ignotus (in-gnotus), although
he has just said fama notus: his person is unknown, though his
fame has spread—Libyae, the only continent left, as he has been
driven froin Asia (Troy) and Europe (Thrace), and is still· forbidden to
reach Italy.

385. plura querentem, beginning to compluit! further (conative
pres, ξ 276, ὣς G. 224), compare Ecl. i. 29, and note. — uec, and not
(qualifying passa). Notice that the Latin likes to combine negative and
connective in one word.

387. haud invisus caelestibus, i.e. it is by favor of heaven that you
have arrived in this hospitable land.

588. qui adveneris, subjunctive as giving the reason (ξ 320, e;
G. 636, referred by H. to 517).

389. perge modo, onlygo on, and you will find good fortune.

390. reduces: a common use of two accusatives in apposition
after verbs of knowing, saying, etc. (ξ 186, c; G. 3343 H. 373). We
may supply esse, but the construction is older than the infinitive with
the accusative, and is no doubt the origin of the indirect discourse
construction.

392. ni frustra, etc„ i.e. unless I ain quite ignorant of the science.——
augurium (avis, and an uncertain verbu-000: she relieves his anxiety
without betraying herself as a goddess. The flight of birds was the most
common means of divination3 hence augurium and auspicia (avi-spe-
cio). —- vaui,fizlse{v (ξ 191), not necessarily implying any conscious de-
ceit on the part of the parents.

393 et seq. This passage has given more trouble than seems neces-
sary. The swans are represented in two groups, one alighting (terras
capere), and the other looking down on the place where the first has
alighted (terras captas). They are again described, the former as 're-
duces, the latter in cinxere, etc, in 398. The ships correspond to these
two groups: those alieady in (portum tenet), to the former, and those

just coming in (subit ostia), to the latter.
