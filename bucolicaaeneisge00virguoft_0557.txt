rise to new formations‚ while they themselves have disappeared.
The new formations- have given rise by analogy to others seeming
to be formed like them from lost stems, which, however, perhaps
never existed at all. For instance, the forms in -bundus and
—cundus are unquestionably originally formatious from stems in
-bon and -con, which are themselves formations from stems in -bo
and -co, and these in turn have been formed by adding -lms and -cus
(bo and co) to simpler stems or roots. It has been attempted by
hints and cross references to indicate these gradual developments,
and it is hoped that the treatment will present to many persons
new views of Latin stem-formation. It is not desired that all pupils
should learn this etymologica] matter3 but the author has been led
to insert it on account of the want of any such means of information
in an accessible form.

The actual quantity of vowels, where known, has been indicated,
irrespective of syllabic quantity, in order to aid the proper pronun-

ciation of Latin words.
