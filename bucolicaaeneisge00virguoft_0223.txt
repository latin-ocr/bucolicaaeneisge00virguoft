AS virgil is the first Latin poet with whom most students be-
come acquainted‚ some general suggestions to the learner may not
be out of place. ·

The poetry of the ancients depends for its rhythm not upon
accent, but upon quantity. That is, it was in a manner sung, and
not read. A long vowel was to the ancients really such, and oc-
cupied—in speech as well as in verse—twice the time of a short
one. Much may be gained by constantly bearing this in mind, and
never reading a line without preserving its metrical form. Once
acquire the moveinent of the “strai11,'' and the line may be read
metrically without thinking at all of tlte quantit-y of particular sylla-
bles‚· for the rhythrn will then become perfectly natural, and the
prosody will cause no trouble, except in a few cases, especially if at
first the time is beaten as in music. Thus the first five lines of the
First Eclogue may be represented as follows ε —-

ΝοτΕ. —It must be remembered, however, that the long quantity marks as here given
do not always indicate long vowels but long syllables. Many os the long syllables have

short vowels, but are made long by the distinct pronunciation os the consonants following
the voweis.
