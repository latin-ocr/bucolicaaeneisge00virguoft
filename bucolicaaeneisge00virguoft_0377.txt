246. tuno etiam, tlten loo (besides our other warnings). —— Cassan-
dra, daughter of Priani. She had been beloved by Apollo, and endowed
by him with the gift of prophecy; but, as she rejected his suit, the gift was
accompanied with the curse that no one should believe her inspired words.
(See lsig. 66, where she appears on the walls in the act here described.)—
satis (abl. of manner).

247. non credita, [those lips] never believed, eto—Teucris, da-
tive (§ 232, (ις G. 3523 H. 388, 1).

248. quibus esset (ξ 320, e3 H. 515, iii.): though that day was our
last (contrasting the signs of joy with their real sate). Notice how this
idea is brought out by the position of miseri before quibus.

249. velamus, i.e. we decla llze slzm'ncs (delubra) with fcslal wreallzs ,’
decking the houses with garlands had a religious as well as festival meaning.

250. ruit oceano, comes suddenly from tlte ocean .’ Night, like Day,
is conceived as rising from the vast Ocean which encireles the earth.

251. involvens ε the grave effect of the Spondees in this verse is per-
haps intentional.

252. dolos: the same shadow which makes them helpless aids the
craft of their enemies. —- fusi, compare i. 314.

253. conticuere, became silent, i.e. were lzuslzesl.

254. ibat, was alreaczsv οη ils way, anticipating the success of Sinon’s
fraud.

255. Tenedo (ξ 258, 11.3; G. 411, R.1; H.412‚1).—per amicasi-
lentia lunae Ξ by llle still mzclfi‘iendly ›noonlrg‘lzl (compare v. 340),

256. flammas . . . extulerat, llze royal slzip had slzorrrn llle signal
leg-ht, as a sign to Sinon. (Compare vi. 517, where Helen is said to have
held forth a lighted torch as a signat) This clause should properly be the
subordinate one, but, as often, is emphasized by its present form. See
ξ 325, b3 G. 581, R.

257. fatis deum, cf. vi. 376.

258. utero (loc. abl.). — Danaos . . . claustra, lels laese tlze Greeks
from their pine-wwdprison. As the verb laxat can apply in slightly
different senses to both Danaos and claustra, the llendz‘aaflvs, always a
favorite form of expression, is preferred to the ablative of separation
(claustris).

259. laxat is in the same construction as extulerat, but the action
of the latter verb precedes and that of the former is brought forward to
present time (hist. pres.); hence the great difference of tense—auras,
open air‚· compare iv. 388.

260. cavo robore promunt, compare Od. viii. 500-520; Bry. 613,
where the story is told by Demodocus.
