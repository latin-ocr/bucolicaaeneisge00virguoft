Ι 6 N bles. [Bocor.

plea of Polyphemus, in Theocritus: peeoris referring to sheep, and lactis
to cows (for the genitive see ξ 218, [; G. 373, 4 ; H. 399, iii.).

21. meae agnae, eme lambs os mine. — Siculis, loosely used because
many wealthy Romans had estates in Sicily; and hence, perhaps, taken as
part of the stock imagery from Theocritus. — errant, cf. i. 9.

22. aestate, frigore, the times when fresh milk is most apt to fail.
The lac novum is a curious recommendation of his love3 but it accords
with the ctmventional simplicity of pastoral verse.

23. quae solitus Amphion, etc. : wlzal Amphion used (to sing). He
was the mythic builder of Thebes, whose walls rose to the music of his lyre.
He with his brother Zethus—sons os Zeus and Antiope—were exposed on
the mountain ridge Aracynthus, which separates Boeotia from Attica (Acte),
and brought up by rustics. Dirce is a sountain near Thebes. These epi-
tliets and allusions are affected imitations os authors in whom they meant
something. The hiatus after Actaeo is probably copied literally from the
Greek. ——— si quando z wlmzewr‘ (literally‚ if ever, cf. ξ 316, footnotes).

25. nee sum adeo informis: see preliminary note. —ade0‚ so very.

26. placidum ventis: the ancients seem to have supposed that cer-
tain winds culmed the sea, ——perhaps by ceasing to blow (see [ΕΠ. ν. 763).
The sea-beach might possibly afford a mirror for the giant Cyclops in the
original, but hardly sor the shepherd Corydon here—staret (ξ 325;
G. 5863 H. 521, ii. 2). —- Daphnim, the mythic par-agon of bucolic
poetry (see Ecl. m). —eg0: the Latin likes to represent two persons in
contrast: so here ego is expressed to set off Daphnim, but is not itsels
emphatic.

27. iudice te, simply, in your juasgvnenl.—si (like si quidem),
since.

28. tantum, only (tis all I ask).—libeat (root Lr'ssH, as in love),
(hortat. subj., ς 266 ; H. 483> llml it mig-ht please yvon. —sordida‚ rude,
lzomely.

29. humilis, lautos, modest—figere, bring down (pierce with the
spear).

30. hibisco, lo [lle mamb-mallon* for their grazing. [The dative in
poetry often denotes the end of motion (ξ 225, b: H. 380, 3): perhaps
a relic of an earlier locative form] This interpretation seems the better
one, but it is possible to take the word as ablative, cs. x. 71.

31. canendo, in song.

32, 33. calamos, see note, Ecl. i. 2. These lines are doubtful, and
are exceedingly awkward here. They are probably a parallel passage
written m the margin, which has crept into the text.

34. nee paeniteat, and be nol loath: cf. Tib. i. 4, 47.—trivisse
