Boon VI.

THE main action of this book, the visit to the world of Shades, is ex-
panded from the narratives of Ulysses in the eleventh book of the Odyssey.
But while Ulysses‚ in a region vaguely indicated as at the ends of the earth,
beyond the Ocean stream, simply offers sacrifice and digs a trench about
which the ghosts crowd eager to taste the vietim’s blood, and so hold con-
verse with hi1n3 we have in virgil a definite locality‚ and a vast under-
ground realln of which the entrance is marked by the sulphur springs and
caverns near the bay of Naples, with its well-defined regions of the tor-
mented and the blessed, according to the more developed though philo-
sophie and skeptic opinion of his time. Some passages have been thought
to hint at the initiatory rites of certain mysteries, to which Virgil had him-
self been admitted3 much of the philosophy is Stoic pantheisni ; and the

theory of the vision appears to include the Pythagoream doctrine of me-
tempsychosis. Compare Ovid, Met. XV. 1—487.
