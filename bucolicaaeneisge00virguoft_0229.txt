ECL. L] pastoral Poems. 7

10. ludere, lo sing in spart. —- quae vellem, wlzat J will (imperf. by
seq. of tenses‚§ 287, 113 G. 511, R.²; H. 495; subj. in an intermediate
clause, ξ 342; H. 529, ii.). —— calamo, reed (like avena), strictly, a slalk
of grain. [In this and similar lines, observe the beauty of movement given
by the alternate dactyls and spondees]

11. equidem, l'm suren —111agis z potius, rathen—totis agris
(5 258,f; G. 384, 6; H. 425, 2), throughout tltefields.

12. usque adeo turbatur, lo sta-ll a degree does conficsion prevail
(ilnpers. passive, ξ 146, c; H. 301, 1).—- adeo would properly be cor-
relative to ut in a clause of result, which however 15 made the main clause
(min-01⁸, etc.)‚ and so 110 ut appears d ipse, contrasted with others im-
plied in undique.—capellas, she-gnati· (dimin. form sor the regular
capra).

13. protinus, sat-lber on ,⁴ i.e. I cannot (as usual) find a shelter near
at hand—aeger, sick at bearn—duco, lead (being too weak to be
driven).

14. modo‚jusl now. —namque regularly introduces its clause, but
here the order 15 changed on account of the 1116116. —gemellos (dim. of
geminos, ξ 164, α; H. 321), min-luds.

15. silice in nuda, on. llze baressinl by the roadside, where they must
presently die. — conixa (sor enixa, 011 account of the hiatus), bringing
sorllz with difficulty. The sufferings of the (1111111) creatures add to the
pathos: — reliquit, llas abandoned. Notice how this word, at the end of
the line, contrasts with spem gregis, at the beginning3 the hope is only
to be disappointed.

16. malum hoc, llzis misfhrlttne (exile).-—laeva‚ dull or warpeni
(“left-handed,⁷' compare 1·‘r.gauslze).—si . . . fuisset: i.e. it would
have been a warning, had not, etc. The conclusion is only implied. The
omens were seen, the gods (lid their part, but he was too blind to heed the
warning. Cf. ξ 308, h.

17. de caelo tactas, struck by lightning (the usual phrase). See Cic.
ad Cat. III. viii. 19. — praedicere: for tense see ξ 288, h; G. 277, R. —
quercus: the blasting of the olive, it is said, was understood to predict
barrenness; that of the oak, exile. [Thunder and lightning were good
signs, in some cases'‚ when nothing was blasted by the stroke. Cf. (Llc. de
Div. xxxv. 74. The most important omens were from lightning or from
birds. These were interpreted very variously by the different Italian na-
tions: the Romans made only two classes of anguries from lightning ; 1116
Etruscans eleven. Auguries from birds were either from their song (os-
cines) or from their ssight (alz'les).]
