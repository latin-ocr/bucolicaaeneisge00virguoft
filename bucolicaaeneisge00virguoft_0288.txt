“THE structure of this poem is taken from the latter part of Theocr„
Idyl i.‚ the dying Daphnis supplying the model for Gallus, whose despair,
however, does not in our poet bring him to death. Virgil is supposed to
narrate the story in a song as he is tending his goats, and in rising to go
home for the evening he gracefully intimates that he is closing the volume
of pastoral poetry.'' The scenery (purely conventional) is in Arcadia.
Milton⁷s Lycidas may be compared with profit.

1. Arethusa: conventionally, the nymph of pastoral verse. The
Arethusa is a fresh fountain which rises in the little island Ortygia, the
heart of Syracuse. To account for it, the fable was invented of a nymph
in Elis, who, being pursued by the river-god Alpheus, was changed into a
brool<‚ which (lisappeared in the earth, and after flowing beneath the sea
reappeared in this sacred isle of Diana (Ovid, Met. v. 572—6413 Ᾱῗῃ. iii.
694), The allusion is of course to Sicily, the country of Theocritus.

legat, subj. of purpose (S 3173 G. 632; ΙΙ. 497, i.; cf. note on iv. 33).

3. neget, dubitative subj. (ξ 268; G. 251: H. referred to 485).

4. sic tibi (dat. after intermisceat, ξ 2283 G. 346; H. 386):
compare ix. 30, and note, and Comus, 924, 925 : —

“ May thy brimmed waves sor this
Their full tribute never miss.'’

the Alpheus is represented, ‘⁶ taught by Love, the mischief-making bojw, to
dive‚'⁷ as flowing beneath the sea to visit his love. Here Arethusa appears,
perhaps according to the more common form of the myth, as Hying from
his pursuit under the sea to Sicily, where she arrived without having her
current mixed with the salt water. The myth is here regarded as a con-
tinuing phenomenon. Virgil prays her ‘⁴ to assist his tale of love, as she
would wish to be undisturbed in her passage.'’
