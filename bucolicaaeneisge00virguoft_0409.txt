11. 765] ’ Tlce AEnez'd. 15¹

735. mihi (ς’ 229; G. 344, R.²; H. 385, 2).—male amicum, un-
srienclly, cf. note, v. 23.—-neseio quod: a weak aliquod (ξ 334, e; G.
469, R.2; II. 529, 5).

736. confusam eripuit mentem, rabbad me osmy presence osmind
in my confusion ,· strictly, took away my senses by confusing them (a pro—
leptic use of the participle, as in iii. 236).

737. nota, fizmiliar: regione, dit-action (abstract of rego). Some
by-path had to be followed to avoid capture.

738. misero, best taken as dative (ξ 229; G. 344, R.²; H. 385, 2),
or may be ablative with fato. The passage has given infinite trouble to
cominentators. The most. generally received opinion is that there are
three alternatives: 1st‚ that she stopped simply,⁴ 2d, that she lost the way;
and 3d‚ that she sat down to rest. In this view fato erepta is taken as
true in either case aud belonging with them all. But if these latter words
are referred priinarily to the case which really occurred (cf. non sine
numine, v. 777), and interpreted as referring to a divine interposition hy
which Creiisa stopped behind, some difficulty seems removed. The doubt
then in ,Eneas' mind would be, whether she stopped without any human
agency, as she might well do, being fato erepta, or whether the gods
used some ordinary human means.

Translate: All, wretched me, my wis& Ct'eiisa, either slopped behind,
torn from me by sale, ιη’ slrayccl from ille path, ον tired out sal down lo
rest, it is uncertain tceln'clz.

739. substitit: sor the mood compare ξ 334, ιίς G. 469, R.¹ The
question, however, may possibly he regarded as direct.

741. nec prius . . , quam, nor did l look baele . 0 . until. This want
of care, though strange to us, is in accordance with the manners of the
ancients. [Eneas’ chief care would be sor Iulus. Of course in following
the legend there is a necessity for getting rid os Creiisa.

743. venimus, see ξ 327, c; G. 576; H. 520.—collectis omni-
bus (ablative absolute, ξ 255), wlzen all were gzzllcered. — una, slze
alone.

744. fefellit, was missed by. Notice that the word is transitive in
Latin.

745. deorumque (to avoid the recurrence of sound there would be
in deumque> ε the enclitic que is elided by synapheia (ξ 359, c; G. 738,
R.; H. 608, ΝΡ). - amens, in my madness.

749. fulgentibus armis, no longer seeking to avoid notice. His
armor would have been brought by some one of the servants. —eingor
(ξ 111, N.¹; H. 465).

750. stat, my purpose isfixed (ξ 270, [η H. 538).
