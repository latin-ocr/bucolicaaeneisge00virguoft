ΙΙ. 190-] lee AEnez'd. 125

177. Pergama, the citadel of Troy.

178. omina: Virgil here transfers a Roman custom to the Homeric
Greeks. All enterprises were undertaken by the direction of the gods,
who were supposed to dwell in the city, and were consulted by auspices
before setting out; and if the event was unsuccessful, the auspices must be
taken again in the city, and the whole be begun anew. The term sor
this was repelere auspicia, of which repetere omina is here a variation. —
Argis, from ,myos—repetant (§ 3365 (3. 6533 H. 524). —numen‚
llzefizvoringpresence of the gods, as shown by renewed savorable auspices.

179. pelago (ξ 258,g)‚ by sea, —curvis carinis (ς’ 248; G. 4033
H. 420), in tlze crooleed slzz'ps ‚· cf. Il. ii. 297.

180. quod, in Μαί (ξ 333, a ; H. 540, iv.). The antecedent or main
clause is parant, etc.

182. digerit omina, interpreti· tlte omens, i.e. those referred to in
vv. 171-175. The word omen (root in os, oro) properly means any
casually spoken word which serves as a prognostic os the future. It is
used here, as very commonly, for visible signs which were properly ostensa,
portenta, prodzjgia.

183. pro Palladio, in lieu oftlze Palladimn ,· pro numine, in pror·
pitialion of llze cff’nded dz'vz'nz'ly. The goddess is however identified with
her image the Palladium, hence pro can be used with both, though not in
preeisely the same sense.

184. triste, gloomy (in its effect).

185. The gist os the idea is in immensam molem. They were to
make it huge so as to keep it where it would protect them, and not the
Trojans. ---tamen³ i.e. though it was in lieu of the Palladium, yet it was
to be of no service to the Trojans.

186. caelo (ξ 225, b; G. 344, R.3; H. 384, 4), lo tlte sky.

187. recipi and duci are branches of the same general idea; neu
introduces a different one. Sinon at once accounts for the size of the
horse, and hints at the disposal of it which he desires.

188. antiqua, i.e. just as formerly under the protection of the Pal-
ladium. —- religione: this word implies both piely (religious veneration),
the sanclz'ly which calls it forth, and the object which possesses that sanctity.
Here it seems to be used with a confused notion of all, chiefly the last.

189. donum Minervae (obj. ge11,)‚gisl lo Minerva.—violasset‚
ind. dise. for future perfect (ξ 286, R.; G. 516; H. 525, 2).

190. quod di . . . convertant, may tlte gods lm'n the omen against
himself The ancients had a curious notion that the anger of the gods
must be satisfied, but that it might by prayers be turned upon something
else‚—a notion which seems to be the foundation, in very ancient oriental
