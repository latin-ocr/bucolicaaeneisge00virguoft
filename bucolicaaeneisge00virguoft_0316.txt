289. caelo: Augustus was honored as a divinity before his death¹
though no temples were erected to him in Rome (see Horace, Odes, pas-
sim).——Orientis: the allusion is prob-
Fig. 46. ably to the surrender by the Parthians
of the standards taken from Crassus (ef.
vii. 606).

292. cana, unsullied, a type of
purity and dignity: so applied to Veri-
tas and Vesta as well as Fides. —
Fides: one of the most characteristic
features of the Roman religion was the
worship of abstract qualities‚ as Faith,
Honor, Modesty‚ Fortune. — Vesta, god-
(less of the Hearth (see note, v. 68).
For a representation of her see Fig. 46.
— Quirinus, a Sabine god of war (quiris, spem), with whom Romulus

mon legend.
293. ferro, depending on claudentur (abl. of means).

time of war and closed in peace. They

(to whom the actions in vv. 295 and 296
belong) as well as Furor seem to be here
confounded with Janus. For the temple of
Janus see Fig. 47. —impius: alluding to the
civil war, a conflict between persons bound
together by a common kindred and religion.
