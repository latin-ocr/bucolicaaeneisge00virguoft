23. per nives, i.e. over the Alps into Gaul.--h01·rida, contrasted
with the softness of rural scenes.

24. Silvanus (sometimes confounded with Pan): originally a forest
deity, but afterwards regarded as a god of gardens and plantations‚ and the

special guardian of the boundaries of peasants' properties, a sunction indi- ·

cated hythe fennel and filies—agresti honore, with the rustic honor
oflzis head.

25. quassans, shaking as he moved. For form see ξ 167, b; H. 336.

26. Pan : a formidable nature-diviuity (Theocr. i. 16), the sudden
sight of whom produced “paine'' maduess. The vision of him (quem
vidinlus ipsi) was a special hoon vouchsafed the poet.

27. ebuli, elder, a plaut of peculial· sacredness.—1nini0‚ vermz'lion
(compare vi. 22). The details give reality to the vision. Images of the
gods (especially the rustic deities) were often painted red.

29. nee lacrimis, i.e. Love is no inore satiated with lovers‘ tears than
grass with irrigating streains (iii. 111, eto). These rustic images are appro-
priate to the god Pan, who is doubtless thinking of his own lost love Syrinx.

31. at illes Gallus, who rejects the offered comfort.-—t-amen‚ i.e.
despite my woe. ¹

32. cantare, see ξ 273, d.

33. quanl lnolliter‚ lww sweelly ngvlzt my frame repose, zf one day
your pipe should sing my low.

35. utinam: a regret that he had not shared the humble life of shep-
herds.-—fnissem, see ξ 267, b; G. 2543 H. 483, 1.

37. certe . . . iac-eret z the rustic maid orsun-burnt boy would prove
a truer love. See ξ 3oS; G. 599; H. 5¹0· —fuscus‚ sc. est.

39. nigrae, compare ii. 18.

40. salices, willon-ac, on which vines were sometimes but rarely trained.
The reading calices, caps, has been suggested ; compare Hor. Od. i. 38, 39.

42. hic gelidi fontes : 111 this calm sweet place, why might not
Lycoris herself be content to abide with me? hut my mad passion for war
(amor (luri Martis) keeps ane 111 arms, while she —let me not believe it,
etc. The shepherd-lover, the poet, and the man-at-arms are as rudely con-
fused here as the two characters of Tityrus in the First Eclogue. Some of
these verses are said to he taken from Gallus's own compositions. y

46. sit, equal to liceat. Let me not believe so cruel a thought.

47. Alpinas nives, mere images of horror to the Roman mind. Many
things which we should eall sublime in nature, the ancients seem to have
thought of only as tedious or terrihle, and did not enjoy. Thus Julius Caesar
whiled away his time among the Alps by composing an essay on Grammar,
—dura‚ Ιιανιζν as well as fruel.
