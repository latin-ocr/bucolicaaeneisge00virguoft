point of view. Comp. ope barbarica, used by Ennius os the same palace.

506. forsitan, eto, compare G. ii. 288.—1·equi1·as (ξ 311, (13 G.
250; H. 485) τ this particular construction with forsitan (sors-siban) is

5¹2- nudo sub aetheris axe, under tlze open canopy of heaven (see
v. 487): in a Roman house, the Penates were kept by the family hearth
and altar, in the atrium, or principal hall, but not in the open air3 here,
however, is apparently meant a great hall or court, which had a larger
opening than the atrium, and contained a garden, or at least a trec or two.
(See Fig. 71.) Virgil could hardly have in mind a Roman atrium, for the
open part was occupied by a sort of cistern, walfluvium, and could not be
occupied by the Penates; nor could he exactly mean the front court of a
Greek house, in the centre of which was the altar of Zfiv2³1<11uamffl but
probably had in his mind a vague mixture of the two. something like the
Roman peristyle. There was a legend, however, that Pyrrhus was slain on
the altar at Delphi because he had himself violated the altar of Ζεὺς by
the murder of Priam.
