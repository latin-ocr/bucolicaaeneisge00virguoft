782. imperium aequabit, compare i. 287. — terris (ἓ 225 ; G.
343³ H· 384, ih)-

783. septem arces, llze seven lzeiglzls (seplimontium) ,· the name was
first given to the Palatine‚ with its spurs and those of the adjoining Esqui-
line; it was afterwards extended to the larger group of the “seven hills‚”
with which at first it had nothing to do.

784. felix prole virum, blessed willz a progeny of heroes, as Cybele,
‘⁶ mother of the gods.'⁷ Her name Berecyntia is derived from Mt. Bere-
cyntus in Phrygia. She is represented with the turreted crown (turrita)
worn by personified cities. (See Fig. 80, p. 161.)

788. geminas acies, bollz your eyes, an expression suited to the pro-
phetie enthusiasm of Anchises.

790. caeli sub axem, [aeneam the great arrlz oflzeaven.

792. aurea condet saecula, etc.² shall found again llze golden age,
llcronglz {lle fields once ruled by Lalian *S'alurn‚· see Ecl. iv. 6, and Intro-
duction.

794. super Garamantas, bqyond the Garamantes, a tribe of interior
Africa, which sent an embassy to Augustus. How this struck the Roman
imagination is seen in the following verses. —- Indos ε the reference is to
the East‚ generally. When Augustus was in Syria (B.C. 20), embassies
from the Parthians and Indians restored the standards taken more than
thirty years before from Crassus.

796. extra . . . vias, i.e. beyond the tropics. Compare the expres-
sion of Gray, referring to the Arctic regions,—

“ In elimes beyond the solar rond.’' — Progress quoesy.

Erymanthi pacarit nemora, i.e. by killing the wild boar. —— Lernam,
referring to the Hydra. These exploits of Hercules were all within the
limits of Arcadia, and so give no great notion of his wanderings. Atlas,
Antaeus, and Geryon might have suggested a wider range.

805. Liber, see note, Eel. vii. 58. The triumphant march of Bacchus,
in the sable, led him as far as India. His car was drawn by tigers or

lynxes, guided by reins of vine-branch. (See Fig. 15, p. 33, and cf.
Fig. 122.)
