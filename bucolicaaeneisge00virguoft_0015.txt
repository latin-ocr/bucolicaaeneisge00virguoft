This Journey proved fatal to him. He was tall, spare,
swarthy, and of consumptive temperament. His deli-
cate lungs hardly bore the harsh air of the coast, while
his frame was racked with sea-sickness‚ and worn with

voyage. He barely lived to reach Italy, and died at
Brundisium September 22, B.c. 19, aged not quite 51.
Unwilling to leave the AEneid in its unfinished state,
he is said to have ordered it to be bumed, and to have
hardly yielded to the request of Augustus that it might
be left to the judgment and revision of his friends,
Tucca and Varius. He was buried, by his own desire,
near Naples ; where, at the erest of the rock that over-
hangs the grotto of Posilin* beneath a low ivy-grown
roos of stone, the traveller may still read his modest
epitaph :—
MANTVA ME GEerr : CALAssm RAPVERE : TENET NVNC
PARTHENOPE : CECINI PASCVA RVRA DVCEs.

shrubbery, and so down upon the tomb. This is a little sheltered hollow,
uplifted on the hillside, roofed with stone, and in one corner a grave-stone
(which looked rather business-like), inscribed, ‘IN MEMoRlAM P. VIR-
GILH MARoNis,’ in ordinary sashion.”
