to v. 444. In this particular case, however, the constellation would be
seen at the same time of year, rising just after sunset ; so that Virgil may
have confounded the second and the fourth phenomenon. It should be
borne in mind that in the great lapse of time between the earliest allusions
to these matters and Virgil's time, as well as from his to our own, the pre·
