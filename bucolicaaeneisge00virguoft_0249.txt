Ecr. 1V.] Pastoral Poems. 27

ECLOGUF, IV.

THIS Eclogue was by a curious misapprehension long supposed to refer
to the coming of Christ, and regarded as inspired. Compare Pope's
‘¹ Messiah‚'‘ a professed imitation.

1. Sicelides Musae, Sicilian musas, i.e. those of pastoral song, so
called because Theocritus was a Sicilian. - maiora, greater than the
loves and rivalries of shepherds. — canamus (ξ 266 ; G. 256 ; H, 484, ii.).

2. myricae, lmztlzer (see Index), a plant sacred to Apollo. —omnis‚
notice the quantity of the i.-arbusta‚ i.e. the simplest rural subjects.
If the poem is to be rural at all, let it be on a higher key.

3. consule, Pollio.
4. Cumaei, i.e. the Sibylline books sold to king Tarquin by the Cu·

mcean Sibyl. The Sibyls were prophetie nymth like the Camemz» (iii. 59),
but were independent each of the others. Ten principal ones are men-
tioned, of whom two had their homes in Italy: the Cumaean (Amalthea),
and the Tiburtine (Albunea). For the prophetie character of the Sibyl,
see AEneid, Book vi. The supposed Sibylline books were destroyed when
the Capitol was burned in Snlla’s time 3 but about a thousand verses, which
were reputed genuin'e, were gathered afterwards, and religiously preserved.
They seem to have contained chiefly directions for religious ceremonies.

5. magnus ordo: this was the series of four saccula, each mesalum
counting properly one hundred years, though it had come to be reckoned
at one hundred and ten (see Mommsen, Ro'm. Chron. p. 184). These four
saecula were of gold, silver‚ brass, and iron: the iron age was now closing
(see v. 8), and the golden was to begin anew (ab integro). In sympa-

B.C. 17. With this idea were also mingled notions of astronomical cycles,
and of the successive worlds of the Stoics.

6. virgo: i.e. the goddess Astma, known on earth as Justice, said to
have been the last of the divinities to quit the earth amid the crimes of the

Iron Age z

Ultima caelestum, terras Astraea reliquit. —Ovid, Met. i. ¹50.

Saturnia: the early Golden Age was associated with the reign of the
old {talian god ot' husbandry, Saturnus, — afterwards confounded with the
Greek Kronos, father of Zeus, — under whom peace and justice were be-
lieved to have been undisturbed,in a time of great simplicity of life, includ-
ing a diet of acorns and wild fruits before the cultivation of grain. — redit,
