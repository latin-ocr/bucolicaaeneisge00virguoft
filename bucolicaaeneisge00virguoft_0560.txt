ABBREVIATIONS.

l

 

fi..—-Actually long vowels are marked without reference to syllabic quantity,
and all vowels (in the words when first presented) not marked long are
supposed to be naturally short, although the syllable may be long by
position. The pronunciation will of course depend on the rules learned
from the grammar.

[ ]. — All matter in square brackets is etymological.

[Gr. Αἵολος]. - Α Greek word in brackets preceded by Gr. indicates that the
Latin word is borrowed from the Greek one given.

['?] . —— The interrogation in brackets marks a doubtful etymology: after a word
or suggestion it indicates, as usual, a doubt, or a suggestion not yet gen-
erally received.

†Servo. — A dagger marks a stem, or, in some cases, α word not found in Latin,
but which must once have existed. Such stems and words are printed
in different type.

DHA. — Capitals indicate Indo-European words or roots,

xsfer. — The radical sign is used for convenience to indicate a root. By this
is meant the simplest Latin form attainable by analysis; though, strictly
speaking, a root is impossible in Latin, as roots had ceased to exist, as
such¹ ages before Latin was a separate language.

as if. — The words as zf indicate that a word is formed according to such an
analogy, though the actual growth of the word may have been different.

Wh. — whence is derived.

cf. — Compare, either for resemblance, contrast, or etymological kinship.

poss. — possibly.

prob. — probably.

(-). -,Α hyphen indicates composition.

composition, derivation, or inflection.

strengthened. -— The word strengllzened indicates a vowel change by which
the length osa root vowel is increased; as dcliv„ †Dyau, «suu, †nau.

vowel scale; as from a to ο or e, 0 to e or ι’, etc.
