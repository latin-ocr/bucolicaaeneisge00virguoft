PASTORAL POEMS.

—000-

THESE ten short pieces, the earliest authentic works os Virgil, treat of
pastoral subjects, the loves and songs of herdsmen (βουκόλοι), and hence
are called BUCOLICS. They were published under the title of ECLOGUES
(ἑκλογαί, selections). In form they are chiefly imstations, often transla-
tions, of the IDvLs (flamma, or picture poenis) of Theocritus and the
other Greek pastoral poets; but the scenes often belong to Italy, the
occasions to the history of the time, and the incidents to the poet's own
life.

In a highly artificia] period, such as that under the Empire, or in the
lull after great convulsions like those which marked the downfall of the
Roman Republic‚ the simplicity and quiet of rustic lise have often, by a
kind of affectation‚ been admired and celebrated in song, by persons very
far removed from a rustic condition, These first poetic essays—-though
in the highest degree artificial, and imitations of far superior originals—
have, by their perfection of form, delicacy of treatment, and charm of
diction, taken rank, in the juclgment of every age since, as models in their
kind.

ECLOGUE I.

IN this poem Virgil sings his gratitude to Augustus for restoring the
sarm of which he had been robbed to reward the soldiery of the triumvir-s
(see Life). The poet himself, however, is only dimly shadowed in the
person of Tityrus, a herdsman, in dialogue with another, Meliboeus, who
represents Virgil's less fortunate neighbors. The whole scene with its
incidents, thus removed to the mythical domain of pastoral poetry, gives a
peculiar delicacy to the praise.

MELIBOEUS. TITYRUS.

ITYRE, tu patulae recubans sub tegmine fagi
silvestrem tenui Musam meditaris avena3
nos patriae fines et dulcia linquimus arva:
