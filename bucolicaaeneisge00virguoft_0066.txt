.34 Tlce Epic of AEneaS.

The subject of the [Eneid is the destruction of Troy, the seven years'
wandering of Ainea& and his settlement in Italy, with the wars raised
against him by the native princes, all of which events finally resulted in
the establishment of the city of Rome. The line of tradition followed by
Virgil was somewhat as follows: The city of Troy had for many ages been
under the special care of the gods. Its walls had been built by Poseidon
(Neptune) and Apollo, and were impregnable, except under the condi-
tions strictly prescribed by the edict of the gods. Prince Ganymede had
been borne by an eagle to Olympus to serve as cupbearer at the celestial
banquets. Tithonus, brother of Priam, was the husband of Eos (Aurora).
Priam and Anchises had both in their youth been renowned for beauty.

But the royal house had fallen into the oriental vices of luxury and
treachery. Laomedon, father of Priam, had incensed the hero Hercules
by withholding the sacred horses, the promised reward sor the rescue of
his daughter, and was slain by the hand of Telamon. The royal palace
had become a seraglio, where Priam's fifty sons, by his numerous wives,
made one great pampered household. Hector, the eldest, was noble, pa-
triotic, and brave. But Paris was vain and false. His mother Hecuba
had dreamed that she bore a firebrand ; and at birth he was exposed to
perish in the forests of Mount Ida. Being preserved, and living as a
shepherd on the mountain, he was visited by the three great goddesses —
Hera (June), Pallas, and Aphrodite—to award the prize of beauty
among them, the golden apple of discord. His reward for bestowing the
prize on Venus should be the most beautiful of living women for his
bride. This was Helen, wife of Menelaus, king of Sparta, daughter of
Zeus (Jupiter) and Leda ; and a wrong to her was to be revenged by all
the heroes and chiefs of Greece, who had been her suitors. Paris visited
Sparta, “with flower-embroidered raiment and bright in gold,'' and car-
ried her away to Troy. Hence the famous ten years' siege, and the de-
struction of the sacred city. .

About the tale of Troy had gathered a vast body of legendary adventure,
contained in the “ Cyclic Poets‚⁷' the festa] Odes, the Attic Tragedies, and
above all in the great Homeric poems, the ILIAD and ODYSSEY. The Iliad

is but an episode of the war. It tells the disasters which befell the Grecian
