Ecr. X.] pastoral Poems. 63

48. me sine sola, alone without me, like Chaucer‘s “alone, withouten
any company.'’ —— ne . . . laedant, perhaps as a cantion, rather than as a
prayer (cf. Ovid, Met. i. 508).

50. Chalcidico versu, certain elegies (probably) imitated by Gallus
from Euphorion, a poet of Chalcis (see Cic. Tusc. iii. 19). These were to
be adapted to the pastoral verse (pastoris avena), and carved on the
hark os trees,

52. spelaea, dens, a Greek word, of very rare use.

53. pati, endum lcardsliip. — malle, ie. rather than take any comfort.

54. crescent! as the trees grow, so his love shall expand‚ — a pretty
image, often illustrated in the unshapely letters cut in green bark. Amores
is said to he the title os Gallus's elegies, making a mild play of words

55. lustrabo, will range, as a hunter over Maenalus, attended by
pymphs (see Georg. iii. 40).

56. Parthenios saltus: Mt. Parthenius is on the eastern border of
Arcadia.

57. circumdare: the regular way of hunting was to surround the
wood and so catch the game.—- canibus, see ξ 225, α’.

58. iam, even now.— sonantis, eclwz'ng:

59. Cydonia: Cretan bowmen had the same same among the Greeks
as the Parthian among barbarians. — torquere, a word properly applied to
the rctlzz't’ling‘ of the sling; hence, commonly, to ltzcrlitzg the spear, and
iinproperly, as here, to shooting the arrow. Like the vulgar “tire a stone.''

60. tamquam sit, see ξ 312 ; G. 604; H. 513, ii. — haee, agi-eeing
with medicina (ξ 195, d; G. 202, κρῆ H. 445, 4). The poet here has a
lucid interval and sees theuselessness of his acts.

61. (leus ille, that merciless deity (Love). —- mitescere, relent.

62. hamadryades, i.e. the nymphs of the forest, as in v. 55 ; strictly,
those whose life is bound up with the single tree which is the dwelling of each.

63. rursus concedite, again fczrezcrelL—-as if he wished them out
of his sight (compare viii. 58).

64. illum, i.e. amor.—- possunt, for tense see ξ 307, d.

65. frigoribus (compare Theocr. vii. 111), referring to the extremes of
heat and cold. — mediis, see ξ 1933 G. 386; H. 441, 6.— Hebrum, Sitho-
nias nives: for the horror with which the Romans regarded the Thracian
winters see Ovid, Trist. iii. 3. -. bibamus, see § 307, (a G. 598; H. 509.

66. aquosae, rainy, a general epithet of winter, true enough for Italy,
hut not so true for Thrace.

67. liber aret: so hot that the very inner bark withers and dies upon
the elm. [lt has been suggested to read aret Liber, which would mean
the withering os the grape-vine in the extreme heat, as in vii. 58.]
