2 72 v Notes. [AENEID VI. 900.]

anecdote relates that, when virgil recited these lines before Augustus,
Octavia swooned 3 and on her recovery ordered ten thousand sesterces to
be given to the poet for each of the verses in which mention was made of
her son.

885. inani munere, idle ses-vice, because the boy would never come
to maturity. ’

887. aeris campis, cf. largior aether, 7¹. 640.

889. famae . . . amore, wilh desire os‘llle coming gloa'y.

893, geminae portae: this description of the horn and ivory gates
is taken froni the words of Penelope to Odysseus (Od. xix. 562—567 ; Bry.
678). In the Greek, the fulfihnent or non-fulfilment of the dream is hinted
by a play of words (κέρας, [φαίνω ; ε”ἓέφαςΥ ἑλεφαίρωμαι). There is no such
significance in Latin 3 and Virgii appears to have adopted the imagery as
part of the Homeric tradition, and also to hint at another passage from the
land of drealns than that by which AEneas had entered. By those who
think this book a symbolie exhibition of certain mysteries, the legend of
the Gates, with the ‹lisxnissal of *Encas from the ivory one, is considered a
warning that the language may not be taken lsterally, or understood except
by the initiated. —— fertur, is azyma-led (citing the above legend).

900. recto litore, along tlzc shore.
