is met by Venus in the guise of a huntress, who tells him of Dido's flight
from Tyre and her founding of a city on the African shore, and 'then
directs him to the rising towers of Carthage‚ first making them invisible by
a miraculous mist (305—417). He admires the new city; sees in the temple
of Juno the pictured story os the 'stojan war ς and at length (still unseen)
beholds Queen Dido, attended by some of his own companions whom he
thought lost, who come as envoys from the scattered ships (418—519).
The appeal of the shipwrecked men moves the compassion of Dido: upon
which the mist dissolves, and AEneas appears before the queen (520—593).
He declares himself, recounts his losses‚ and greets his restored com-
panions: Dido receives him to royal hospitality in her halis (594—642).
Achates is despatched to the fleet for the young Ascanius ; but, by a strat-
agem of Venus, the god Cupid is brought instead, disguised in the like-
ness of the boy prince: at the banquet he inspires in the queen a fatal
passion for st'Eneas (643—722). The night passes in feasting and song,
when Dido requests of ,Eneas the connected story of his wanderings

RMA virumque cano, Troiae qui primus ab oris
