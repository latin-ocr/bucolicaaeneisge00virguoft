158. pecora, domestic flocks (as he calls them).

159. fulvum, a mere ornamental epithet. In French, wild animals
are called by the general name bbtes sczuves (fulvoe).

164. tecta, wellen—amnes, broad rivers, a descriptive exaggera-
tion: the word is properly applied to navigable streams.

166. pronuba, marriage-goddess (a regular epithet of Jun0; cf. note
v. 59): but the title is also given to a matron who conducts the bride to
the brida] chamber, which function Juno performs here. The special
function of Tellus is unknown. The imagery is of ambiguous tokens
of marriage: lightnings represent the, torches, and the sounds of the tem—
pest the shouts, while the gods of earth and air attend the eeremony.

167. dant signum, apparently as auspices nuptiarum. Originally
the omens were taken at a wedding, and in later times persons attended
as auspices, using probably some set form of words, though no omens

 

 

 

were actually taken. Here Tellus and Juno seem to be conceived as
auspices, and to give the signal for the marriage to proceed. At the same
time the ceremonies which belong to each of them (the phenomena of
the air and the effects of the storin on the earth) are added, in chiastic
order. — conscius, a witness.

168. conubiis, dative (ξ 234; H. 400).—ulula1·unt: referring to
the festive eries or song which accompanied the marriage processidn, but
doubtless here implying also an evil omen.—— summo vertice, i.e. of the
trees. As ignes refers to the lightning, so ulularunt appears to repre-
sent the roaring of the wind in the tree-tops. Some eeremonies of a
Roman marriage are represented in Fig. 94.

169. primus (ξ 1913 G. 324, R.⁶; H. 448).

Met. xii. 39-63. “
