There are, however, many peculiarities of form and construction.
The most frequent of these—besides Greek forms of inflection—
are: 1. the omission of prepositions‚ especially with the locative
ablat1v03 2. the free use of the dative in preference to other con-
structions3 3. the genitive (of specification) with adjectives3 4. the
constant use of the infinitive (instead of the gerund or a clause)
to express purpose ancl result. In general, we may say that more
is demanded (gf tlte cases than the more highly developed construction
of prose will admit. Some of these forms and constructions seem to
be archaic, retained by a traditional poetic dialect, as, for example,
the omission of prepositions.* Some of them are directly copied
from the Greek, as many cases of synecdochical accusative. The
greatest number, however, are due to both these causes combined,
as the infinitive constructions.

The main difficulty in reading poetry is to determine exactly what
image or idea was in the poet's mind, for it is to be remembered
that poetry requires a more vivid and picturesque use of words than
prose. The learner should therefore not be satisfied with a loose
conception or translation, but should try to see and express precisely
the meaning of the poet's words.

* So in English. “The trumpet spake not lo tlze armbct' lhrong is not antiquated for
poetry ·, although we should not write in a letter, ‘ He spake to me,' or say, ‘ The British
soldier is armed with the English risse.' '³ —- Matthew Arnold, Last Words, p. 21.
