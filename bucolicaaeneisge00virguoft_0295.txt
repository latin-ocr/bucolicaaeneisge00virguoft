Ι. 10.] lee AEnez'd. 67

5. et bello, i.e. his sufferings did not end with his arrival, but con-
tinued in the subsequent wass (ξ 258, s; G. 384, R.¹; H. 425, i.). —dum
conderet (ξ 328; Ο. 573, 574; H. 519, 2), till lle could found: the
subjunctive here shows the act as the purpose of the gods, for although
they thwarted him to please Juno, yet they meant in the end that he should
succeed. ¹ v

6. Latio, into Latium (dative after inferret, ξ 228, but cf. 225, b;
H. 385, 4). Latium is the undulating plain between the Sabine mountains
and the sea: its inhabitants Latini, and its language Latin. 'she name is
assumed to be derived from an ancient king, Latinus: in fact, it was just
the other way; the name of the king is purely imaginary: he is a so-
called eponymous lim-0, i.e. one invented to account for the name. -ιιῃᾱθ,
i.e. from all the soregoing.—Latinum: this is not strictly accurate, as
that race already existed. But in Virgil's time it had long been incorpo-
rated with Rome, and many great families traced their descent from it:
he therefore represents the whole as if sprung from Troy.

7. Albani patres: Alba Longa was the head of the Latin league of
thirty confederate towns. XVhen conquered by Rome, its leading families,
Albanipalres‚ were said to have been transferred to Rome, which now be-
came chief of the confederacy. The term refers here, in general, to the
great senatorial families.

8. Musa, ete. (see note, v. 1) : Virgil follows the regular epic method
in referring all the plot to the gods. — quo numine laeso. Of this much-
vexed passage the hest meaning seems to be, wlml purpose [of Juno] lzav-
z'tzg been tlzwarted? The answer would then be in vv. 12—22‚ as that to
quid dolens is in vv. 23—28. The two causes, then, are that AEneas hin-
dered her plans, and was also personally hateful to her. This view agrees
best also with the etymology of numen, the will or power of the gods as
expressed hy their nod (nuo); and is not inconsistent with the meaning of
laedere (cf. λυμαίυομαι in Xen. Anah. i. 3, 16).

9. quidve dolens, paz‘necl at what .· dolere, to seelpain, is transitive
also in prose. See ξ 237, [13 G. 329, R.¹; H. 371, iii. -tot volvei-e
casus, lo run llle round ο] so many chauces. “The misfortunes are re-
garded as a destined circle which zEneas goes through.'' The infinitive
follows impulerit, by a poetic ise (ξ 331,g; G. 546, R.¹; H. 535, iv.)‚
and has sor its subject virum.

10. pietate (ξ 248 ; G. 403 ; H. 416) : this word means his filial de-
votion in the rescue of his father, as well as his piety towards the gods.
The gods could, however, pursue with vengeance even a pions man, either
because under the power of Fate he thwarted their purposes, or because
his ancestors had committed crimes, as was the case with the descendants
