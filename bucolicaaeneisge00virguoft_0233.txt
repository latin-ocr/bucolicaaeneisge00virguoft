Eci„ 1.] Pastoral Poems. 1 1

46. pascite, εἵατ’ here Virgil drops the allegory: he went to Rome
chiefly to beg his freedom3 and the answer he is supposed to get is to keep
his farm, —fi’eclyour tows and breed your hulloclcs as before (compare note
v. 41). —submittite‚ properly, lo mise fin* me svarpose os breedz’ng, ap-
parently a technical word of graziers and cattle-breeders (see Georg. iii. 73,
159, and Lexicon).

47. tua rura manebunt, tlte fielcls will continue yom‘s. Tityrus is
here no longer the poor slave herdsman, but the yeoman landowner, repre-
senting the poet himself.

48. lapis omnia, etc., however llze bare stone and marslt willz muddy
bulruslc may cover all tlte grazing-ground. This description of a country
alternately marshy and gravelly will be recognized by any one who has
travelled in the territory os Mantua. The idea is: though it is not a very
good sarm, yet it is good enough and a blessed fortune compared with ours.
By some, the passage from quamvis is connected less naturally with
non insueta, etc„ below, and some have referred it to the neighboring
farms.

50. non insueta, etc„ no strange paslnrage will distress your sickly
flock, as is the case with ours. —gravis fetas, the weakling cattle, which
have lately dropped their young (compare line 15).

51. mala, hanefzzL—contagia: plural, meaning many cases of the
disease, as osten in Latin (ξ 75, c; H. 130, 2).

52. flumina nota, familiar streams .· i.e. the course of the “smooth-
sliding Mincius‚” which flows by Mantua

53. fontis sacros, sacredsounls, “ from the pretty superstition which
assigned a divinity to every source and spring.’'—-frigus opaeum, cool
slcade (see note on tegmine, v. 1).

54. hinc tibi, etc„ on this side, as ever, llze lzedge ου the nezgllboa‘ing
roadway, whose willorcrfimcrcr is fid on by llyblaeczn bees, shall often, willz
ils 50ss wlzispering, τοίη yon slcep. Iu this perplexed sentence, quae sem-
per means as it always llas doum floreln is acc. of specification (ξ 240,
c; G. 332; H. 378) by a common Greek construction, aster depasta,
sed upon ,· salicti is the contracted form of saliceti, willam-grove ,·
susurro, [lte rcthe'spering of leaves mingled with the hum os bees ; limite,
strictly, llze le'tie run by public surveyors (agrimensores), (lividing off the
land for purposes of cultivation. (See Georg. i. 126. The term was also
extended to the municipia, and cases of other public boundaries, where the
strict formalities of the Roman system were not followed. It always means
a public boundary, whilefinis is used of private estates. The limes was not
a line, but an open tract, 8, 12, 20, or 40 feet wide, serving as a roadway.
The saepes here described was therefore, strictly, a roadsz‘de lceagae.) —
