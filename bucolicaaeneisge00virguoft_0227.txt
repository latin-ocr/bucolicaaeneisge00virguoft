recubans (root CUB in -eulnbo), rcclining (hackward). The pic-
ture, as often, is much more vivid than we should ordinarily make it in
English—tegmine (root in tego), slzade. Notice in all Latin and Greek
poetry that, on account of the climate, the eoolness of shade and water are
especial objects os delight 3 while hardihood is more often shown by the
endurance of heat than of cold.—fagi‚ beeck. This tree is often men-
tioned as growing on the mountain slopes of northern Italy, whcre herds
were driven in summer. [The same root (mmm) is found iu the Greek
φηγός, the Latin fagus ancl the English bada,- also (since its bark was
used as writing-material) in book. The word is probably connected with
the meaning EAT (qmyfw) from its edible nuts.]

of song, used for song itself. The ancients constantly
identified their divinities with the thing that was their
care. So Ceres, grain. ——nle(lita1·is‚ praclise (μελετᾶν).

ignorance of other places. [The acc. plur. form in es, in place os is, was
coming into use in Virgil⁷s time. The two forms were probably used in-
differently by him (ξ 58; H. 62) *]. —linquimus‚ are leaving (present
