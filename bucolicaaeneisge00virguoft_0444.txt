1 86 Notes. [AENEm.

Boou IV.

IN the episode of Dido, contained in this book, Virgil has not only
come neuter, perhaps, than any other ancient writer to the tone of modern
romantio feeling, but he has succeeded in giving, with remarkable skill, the
picture at once of a fond woman and an oriental queen. It will be remem-
bered that at the time this part of the AEneid was composed, the incidents
of Actium were still fresh, and that the defeat of Antony and the death of
Cleopatra had produced a most powerful effect on the Roman imagination.
Many traits of the royal and imperious Dido, and particularly the passion
of barbaric wrath, pride, and despair, in her last moments, seem to be
suggested by the story of the Egyptian queen, and find their best parallel
in Shakespeare's Cleopatra.

1. at, contrasting Dido’s restlessness with quievit, end of Book iii. —-
gravi . . . cura: notice the interlocked order, and the placing of the
adjective before the caesura, and the noun at the end. — eura, a sore dis-
tress, a regular word for the pangs of love—saucia (always of heavy
wonnds), slrz'cleen.

2. alit venis, i.e. it feeds upon her blood. —— carpitur, z's consicmecl:
the image being of a flame, which catclws snccessively upon the objects
within its reach.

3. animo, the common poetic dative aster verbs of motion. —reeur-
sat, comes baele to her thought. The four points are moral character
(virtus) ,· nobility (gentis Itonos) ‚· persona] beauty (voltus) ‚· eloquence
(verba).

4. pectore (locative ablative).

5. nec dat, andallows nol.

6. postera, . . . Aurora, tlze fhllowing dawn.—Phoeboea‚ ofPJzoe-
bus (the regular use of the possessive adjective). Apollo is naturally eon·
stantly identified with the sun.

8. unanimam, sympallzizing. — male sana, distr-acted: this adverb,
like the English badly, has with good qualities a negative force, with bad
an intensive force ; here of course a negative. -- sororem, see ξ 228, a.

9. insomnia, dreams (e'zrt'vrrmtz), caused by her suddenly-awakened
love. —suspensam‚ in my anxietys compare eura, above.

10. quis, etc.‚ as often happens in Latin, there are here two clauses
compressed into one, W'lco is llzz's, etc.‚ that?
