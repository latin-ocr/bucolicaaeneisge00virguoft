66 Note-s. [AENEID.

THE AENEID.

Boon I.

FRoM the beginning to v. 34 is introductor-y, giving the subject and the
occasion (see argument in text). The real action begins with Juno's solilo-
quy. It will add greatly to the understanding and interest of the AEneid to
consult the corresponding passages in Homer, which are frequently cited,
with references to Bryant's translation (Ery). In general, the first six books
have a certain correspondence with the Odyssey, and the last six with the
Iliad3 but the direct allusions to the Iliad are much more frequent in

the former portion.

lntrodzccloly verses. —The lines, Ille ego, etc., printed before the
AEneid, are by some editors included in the text, but the general opinion

is that they are a spurious addition.

Verse 1. Arma virumque, i.e. the conflicts attending the settlement
in Italy, and the adventures of the hero who led the expedition. Compare
the opening of the Iliad and of the Odyssey. For construction see ξ 237 ;
G. 331 3 H. 371, i. 2). —— primus venit, wlco first came (ξ 191 ; G.
324, R.⁶) : the settlement of Antenor (i. 242, Liv. i. 1) is not reckoned, as
North Italy (Cisalpine Gaul) was not until 42 ΒΕ. considered as belonging
to Italy proper. By some it is made z asold.

2. Italiam, lo Italy.- acc. of end of motion (ξ 258 ; G. 4103 H. 380, 3).
—fato (ξ 245; G. 4073 H. 416) profugus, driven hy sate, i.e. not
merely an adventurer: the verbal adjective here Ξ a perfect participle. —
Lavinia (the last i has the sound of y, as in pinion, and is not counted
in scanning), i.e. the western coast of Italy, where is the town of Lavinium,
assumed to be named for Lavinia, the Italian bride of AEneas. The read-
ing of some editors, Lavina‚ is less approved.

3. ille, etc., tlze man long ἴσω-ἑά· there is no verb to be supplied, but
the pronoun is in a kind of apposition with qui. ——terris‚ alto (locative
abl. ξ 258‚f; G. 384, R.2; H. 425, N.³), by land and on tlze deep.

4. vi, the immediate cause or instrument, while ob iram is more re-
mote, the primary cause3 compare sato above—superurn <gen.pl. ξ 40, e ;
H. 52, 3), of the gods ahava—saevae . . . ob iram, on account os llze ’
ever—mimfful wrallc of cruel June. — memorem, i.e. which would never
let him escape from her mind. luno (z Iovino, feminine form of Iovis) is
the goddess of the sky, represented by the poet as filled with a vindictive and
relentless hatred of Troy, which does not stop at the destruction of the
city, but pursues ,Encas into his distant exile.
