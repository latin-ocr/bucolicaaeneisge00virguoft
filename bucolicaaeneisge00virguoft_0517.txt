of manner or means).

216. ante, in frent. Cypress was apparently first used in the funeral
pile sor the sake of its aromatic odor. Boughs of it were also set in front
of the door of the dead man’s dwelling; here they seem to be set up for
adornment in front of the pile.

217. armis, from a very general notion that these things went with
the departed spirit, and were used by the dead in Hades.

221. purpureas vestes: also a custom at great Roman funerals.—-

239. haud ullae volantes, no flyz'ng creaturas .· just in this neigh-
borhood is situated the famous grallo del cane, in which dogs and other
small animals are smothered by the carbonic aeid accumulated along the
bottom. There is, however, no place dangerous to the flight of birds,
unless it might be the crater of a slumbering volcano.

242. Aornon‚ supposed to be from ἀοριός, Greek for birdless ‚· to this
the corresponding Latin name is Avernum .· the connection with ὄρνις is,
however, impossible. The line has been doubted, one hardly sees why.
