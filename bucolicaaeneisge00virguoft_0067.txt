army from the wrath of Achilles, its most famous champion‚ against
Agamemnon, brother of Menelaus, and leader of the host. Achilles’
absence brings the other heroes to the front,-—the aged Nestor, wisest

of men; Idomeneus of Crete; the wily Odysseus (Ulysses)‚ king of
Ithaca3 Ajax Oileus; the mightier Ajax, son of Telamon3 his brother

Teucer ; and Diomed (Tydides), youngest and bravest of thern all; with
the sons of Atreus, Menelaus and Agamemnon, “lord of men.'’ The
poem ends with the death and burial of Hector, the noblest champion of
Troy, who is slain by Achilles in revenge for the death of his friend
Patroclus. The return of Ulysses to Ithaca, after his long wanderings, is
the subject of the Odyssey3 which contains also the story of the capture
of Troy by the stratagern of the wooden horse, and the fate of several
others of the Grecian chiefs beside Ulysses.

Among the various and conflicting traditions, there was a story that
AEneas, after escaping from the sack of Troy, had taken refuge in Italy.
How old this tradition was, and whence it was derived, is uncertain. It is
not found in Homer or the Cyclic poets, or in any Greek form. The
story, including the episode of Dido, is treated by Naevius (B.C. 235), who
could hardly have invented it. It was alluded to by Ennius (born B.C. 240),
and had been adopted as a favorite theory before the time of Augustus.
virgil supplements it with details drawn from local tradition, and with
many of his own manufacture3 and in this way has connected the im-
perial times with the age of gods and heroes, and formed a sort of back-

ground on which the later history is briefly sketched.

THE wrath of Juno, jealous for the glory of Carthage‚ compels the long
wanderings of AEneas, and detains the Trojan exiles from destined Italy
(vv. 1-33). She beholds them glad on their voyage, and solicits'sEolus,
god of winds, to overwhelm them with a tempest: the storm bursts forth
(34—91). The Trojan fleet is scattered and in peril: but Neptune lifts his
head and stills the waves (92—156). AEneas, with seven ships, reaches the
coast of Africa, where he finds food and rest (157—222). Jupiter comforts
Venus by promise of the coming glories of Rome, and sends Mercury to
move the Tyrian colonists to hospitality (223-304). AEneas, with Achates,
