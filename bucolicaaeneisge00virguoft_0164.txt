BOOK V. — SICILY.

AENEAS, departing‚ sees the blaze of Dido's funeral pile. A storm
threatens, and he turns his course towards Sicily, where he is received with
welcome by Acestes (1—41). He prepares to celebrate with sacrifice and
funeral games the anniversary of his father‘s death (42-103). First con-
test, race of four Galleys3 incidents of the race: the first prize is won by
Cloanthus (104—285). Second contest, Foot-race: Nisus and Euryalus
(288—361). Third contest, the Cestus: Dares and Entellus: the gigantic
strength of the latter, who wields the gauntlets of Eryx (362÷484). Fourth
contest, Archery: the dove shot in mid-air by Eurytion: the fiery ssight of
Acestes’ arrow (485—544). The Equestrian game, Troianus, led by As-
canius in skilful evolutions (545-603). Juno moves the Trojan women to
repining at their long wandering: led by Pyrgo, they set fire to the fleet:
the flames cannot be stayed, until Jupiter sends a timely rain, by which all
the ships but four are rescued (604-699). :Eneas purposes to found a
colony in Sicily ; but is warned in a vision by Anchises to proceed with his
stoutest sollowers to Latium: those who desire remain behind under pro-

tection of Acestes3 the rest set sail (700—778). At the entreaty of Venus,
Neptune, with the Tritons and sea-nymphs, attends his course. The fleet
passes safe upon the waters, with the loss of the pilot Palinurus alone, who,
overcome by the god of sleep, falls into the sea, and perishes (779-871).

NTEREA medium Aeneas iam classe tenebat
certus iter, fluctusque atros Aquilone secabat,

moenia respiciens, quae iam infelicis Elissae
conlucent flammis. Quae tantum accenderit ignem,
causa latet 3 duri magno sed amore dolores 5
polluto, notumque, furens quid femina possit,
triste per augurium Teucrorum pectora ducunt.

Ut pelagus tenuere rates, nec iam amplius ulla
occurrit tellus, maria undique et undique caelum,
olli caeruleus supra caput adstitit imber, 10
noctem hiememque ferens, et inhorruit unda tenebris.
Ipse gubernator puppi Palinurus ab alta:
‘ Heu l quianam tanti cinxerunt aethera nimbi? ·
Quidve, pater Neptune, paras?' Sic deinde locutus
