Even they are playfully represented as sharing in the grief of Amaryllis
and missing their master, not as wanting any special care, but as not finding
the man they were wont to see. The pine here mentioned is probably the
stone-pine‚ planted for its large edible seeds, as well as for shade: valuable
also as furnishing wax and food for bees. The arbusta are the planta-
tions of young elms, on which vines were trained in sestoons from tree to
tree, as in the vineyards of Italy now.

as Horace says (Od. iv. 5), laribus duum miscet numen. Ovid (Fast. ii.
636) describes the ceremony:

Parca precaturi sumite vina manu,
Et Bene vos, bene te„ patriae parer, optz'me Coesar
Dicite suffuso per bona verba mero.

—fllmant‚ i.e. the service is already an established custom: this dialogue¹
