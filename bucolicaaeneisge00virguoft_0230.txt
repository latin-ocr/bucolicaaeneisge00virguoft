19. tamen, still, i.e. notwithstanding my missortunes I would willingly
hear of your better luck. —iste‚ tlmt . . ,you speak of (ξ 102, c; H. 450).
—qui sit (more euphonious than quis sit), what god it is (§ 104, a;
H. 188, 1). —- da (for dic·; so accipe for audi), lell me.

20. urbem: the great city was what first struck his rustic fancy, and
so he begins with that, leaving the question quite unnoticed.

21. stultus ego, sool that l was.——huic nostrae, Mantua, from which
Andes, Virgil's birthplace‚>³< was some three miles distant.

22. depellere, drive down to market from the upland.

23. sic . . . noram (ξ 128, a; H. 297, 2), so l knew (had learned to
know) puppim like dags, and kids like llzeir clams (similis, acc. plur„
§583 H. 67). And so also I compared Mantua to Rome—canibus,
see ξ 234, ‘13 H. 391, i.

24. sic parvis (ξ 229, c), proverbial.— extulit, i.e. when I reached
there.

25, 26. verum haec, etc„ i.e. those do not differ in kind ; but Rome

faggots.

27. Meliboeus here catches his neighbor’s wonder, and sorgets his
question—tibi (ξ 231 ; H. 387).

28. libertas: here we see how little Virgil keeps to the circumstances
of his own case, the allegory being mixed, rather unskilfully, with the real
facts. He himself was really a yeoman, the free owner of a little sarm.
Tityrus is a slave, tending flocks for a noble proprietor, who lived, like most
land-owners‚ in Rome. —respexit‚ rqgarded me: took pity on me, a
word often used of regard from a superior to an inferior. Libertas is here
personified ,as a divinity. — inertem, idle as Ι was, and so not entitled to
it. A thrifty slave might generally buy his freedom in five or six years.

candidior, wlziler and saltitem—tondenti, as J clipped it (ξ 235, (ις
H. 384, 4) 3 a very suitable way of speaking here, for the slave could not
shave his beard till emancipated. Supply mihi. The Latin, for brevity,
often leaves out a pronoun, when a word meant to agree with it is present
to indicate the case of the omitted word. Cf. Caes. B. G., i. 42 (petenti),
i. 47 (cedentes).-eadebat,beg‹cn lofall,· properly, was falling (ξ 324,α; ¹

* The relation in which the smaller places (sora, vici, and conciliabula) stood to the
civitas (municzjbz'nm or colonia) was the same as that of the smaller towns os Attica to
Athens. Mantua was not the capital of the territory, but included the territory. The
citizens were not classed as urban and rural', but the vicus was an integral part os the
civitas, and the village proprietor was politically a member os the city organization.
