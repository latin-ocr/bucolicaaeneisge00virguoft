2 Notes.

The effect is to us, and must have been to the 3116161115, some-
what monotonous. But it is relieved by the variety of dactyls and
spondees, and also by the interruption of feet at the end of words
(Caesam). One of these interruptions at the end of some principal
word, or at some pause in the sense (in the third foot, or less com-
monly, the fourth), is more marked than the rest, and is called lee
Coesura (see Grammar, ἓ 362, b). This main caesura is often a great
help to the sense, and must be observed as an important part of the
structure of the verse. It may be remarked that the verses most
agreeable to the ear are those in which dactyls are more numerous,
or alternate with spondees ς while in the opposite case — especially if
the last foot but one is a spondee (⁶⁴ Spondaic verse 7³) -a slow
and labored movement is given to the verse, which is often very
expressive (see Ecl. iv. 49: s’En. ii. 463-466).

lt is not known with certainty how elided syllables were treated
in reading. It is probabile, however, that the vowels and diphthongs
were so slurred over as to make thern equivalent to y and w, and
that when m was cut off it left a 113531 sound, which was still audible
enough 10 give a 113531 character to the syllable. Where, as in Ecl.
i. 13, elision interferes with the main caesura, the line may be read
without any main caesura, 01 1116 561156 may be sacrificed to the form
of the verse.

This metre is not native to the Latin language, but is borrowed
from the Greek. Hence all poetry written in it has more or less an
artificial character, and requires a conventional poetic diction. The
rules of the metre exclude very many words: all words, for example,
in which a single short syllable comes between two long ones (as in
all the cases of aequitas, longl'lmlcn and similar words3 all except
the nom. sing. of inslila, unless the last syllable 6311 be removed
by elision: and many forms of verb-inflection, asfi³cc7rant)‚ or where
more than two short syllables come together (35 111 Ῑῑῖἔνῖυηιε, Hm?-
νίς, and in gladius, nom.‚ 360, and voe). The necessities of the
metre often give rise to elisions which 111111 1116 flow of the verse (as
in Ecl. ii. 25), 01 10 3111116131 arrangements (as in Ecl. 1. 14, 70).

The Syntax of Virgil, in general, is much easier and simpler than
that of most prose writers, and there are few difficulties of construc-
tion except where the ellipsis of words produces obscurity. The
quantity of syllables, as shown by the 1116116, 15 often an easy guide
to the construction: 35 111 Ecl. i. 38, the long a in suci at once con·
