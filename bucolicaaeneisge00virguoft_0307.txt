148. veluti, just as: introducing the first and one of the most cele-
brated of Virgil's similes. 'she ferocity of a mob and the power of elo-
quence were things very familiar to the Romans. Hence the simile is
proper, though generally the less vivid should be compared with the more
vivid. —- magno in populo: the greater the crowd the more striking the
effect. —saepe belongs· properly to the whole idea, and so is equivalent to
as often happens.

their reason); pectora mulcet, calms llzez'r passion (whose seat is in the

H. 465). But the active
is also common in the sanie sense after Cicero's time ς compare v. 104.
