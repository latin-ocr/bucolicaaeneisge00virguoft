more than one is not clear. Perhaps it was conceived as twofoid: hence
the expression Manes, and the eustom of ereeting two altars to the shade

will be noticed that they are so worded, that they do not prevent the

curses are literally fultilled in the later fortunes ¹of AEneas (see the later
books of the AEneid), including his reign of only three years, and the
loss of his body, which was swept away by the Numicius, or at least was
not found after the battle in which he perished.
