this purpose the etymologica] meaning, where it may not be directly
deduced from the etymology, has been given first in a parenthesis.
Then follow the literal meanings, as nearly as possible in the Sup-
posed order of development, with such hints as could be given of
the connection of ideas. Such renderings as seemed to be neces-
sary in English, but which (lid not accord with the Latin concep-
tion, have been given in their connection as examples. In this
way it is hoped the pupil or teacher may find a good English
expression without losing sight of the Latin conception, which is,
after all, the most important of the three classes of meanings.

Further, an expression rendered by a bare representation of its
ultimate mechanical equivalent, often loses not only all its poetry,
but also the whole conception as it presented itself to the mind of
the original speaker.

the calamity supposed3 a force which vaguely underlies the expres-
sion in English, ‘⁴ Oh, don*t speak of it.⁷’ It can hardly be hoped
that the desired result has been attained 111 all cases, but the idea
has been constantly kept in view. Nor is it supposed that the
expressions given are the only suitable 01165, but it is hoped that
they will be found suggestive.

In regard to the etymology, which occupies more space than is
usual in such books, the author has wished to show not merely
the kinship of words loosely‚ but, if possible, the precise manner
in which one word has been formed from another. The fact is
often overlooked that the Latin language, as we have it, is the growth

of many centuries, during which forms have grown up and given
