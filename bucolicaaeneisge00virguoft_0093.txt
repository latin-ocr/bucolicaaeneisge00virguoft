BOOK IL—-THE FALL OF TRov.

AENEAS begins the tale: the Greeks discouraged, had withdrawn to
Tenedos, leaving the wooden horse, in which chosen warriors were hidden
(vv. 1—39). Laocoon in vain protests against receiving it within the walls:
meanwhile Sinon, pretending to have fied from the Greeks, is received in
confidence by Priam, whom he persuades that the horse is a sacred offering
to Minerva (Δρ-[98). Laocoon and his sons are destroyed by two inon-
strous serpents: the horse is brought with rejoicing into the city, and at
night Sinon sets free the Grecian chiefs (199—267). The ghost of Hector
appears to AEneas, and warns him to fiee. 'she city is seen in flames:
:Eneas and his companions take arms (268-369). Victorious encounter
with a party of Greeks: a disastrous conflict follows, and they come to
Priam’s palace (370—452). Defence and storming of the palace: the fate
of Priam, slain by Pyrrhus, while vainly attempting to protect his son
(453—558). :Eneas returns to his own house — first meeting Helen⁷ whom
Venus warns him not to slay — and beholds in a vision the divinities who
preside at the destruction of Troy (559—633). Anchises at first refuses to
fly, but is encouraged by a divine omen (634—704). AEneas, bearing his
father, and attended by his wife Creiisa, and his son, seeks escape; but,
confused by a sudden alarin, loses Creiisa on the way (705—751). He
seeks her in vain at his palace, which is now filled with the armed enemy ;
bnt she meets him in a vision and coniforts him by assurance of her own
deliverance from hostile hands. At dawn, he finds a numerous company
escaped from the city, with whom he seeks the shelter of Mount Ida
